This code is a simple chat server implemented in C, utilizing socket programming to handle multiple clients.
It allows clients to connect to the server and communicate with each other in real-time. 
The server listens for incoming connections, accepts them, and broadcasts messages received from any client to all connected clients, excluding the sender. 
Here's a breakdown of the code into its major components and functionalities:

# Includes and Constants
- Includes: The code starts by including necessary header files for socket programming and other standard library functions.
- Constants: Defines constants for error messages, buffer size, and the number of ports available.

# Global Variables
- maxfd: Keeps track of the highest file descriptor number to manage multiple client connections efficiently.
- sockfd: The server's socket file descriptor.
- id: A counter for assigning unique IDs to clients.
- client_id_arr: An array to map client file descriptors to their IDs.
- msg_buff: A buffer for storing messages to be broadcasted.
- rset, wset, aset: File descriptor sets used by the select() function to monitor activity on sockets.

# Error Handling Function
- error(): Handles errors by closing the socket if necessary, writing an error message to stderr, and exiting the program.

# Broadcasting Messages
- replyToAll(): Sends the content of msg_buff to all connected clients except the sender. 
It iterates through the file descriptors set in wset and sends the message using the send() function. 
If an error occurs during sending, it calls the error() function.

# Main Function
- Argument Checking: Ensures the correct number of arguments (port number) is provided.
- Socket Creation and Configuration: Creates a socket, sets its address and port, and binds it.
- Listening for Connections: Listens for incoming client connections using the listen() function.
- Server Loop: Continuously checks for activity on the server socket and client sockets using select(). It handles new connections, receives messages from clients, and broadcasts messages to all clients.

# Key Operations
- Accepting New Connections: When a new client connects, the server accepts the connection, updates the message buffer to notify about the new client, and adds the client's file descriptor to the set of active sockets.
- Receiving Messages: For each connected client, the server checks if there is data to read. If so, it reads the message, updates the message buffer accordingly, and sends the message to all other clients using replyToAll().
- Broadcasting Messages: The replyToAll() function is used to broadcast messages to all clients except the sender.
